# Library of Autoencoder-based Residual Deep Network (resautonet)

The python library of autoencoder based residual deep network (resautonet). 
Current version (2.0) just supports the KERAS package of deep learning and 
will extend to the others in the future. 

## Major modules

**model**

* resAutoencoder: major class to obtain a autoencoder-based residual 
      deep network by setting the arguments. See the class and its 
      member functions' help for details.  
* pmetrics: functions for regression metrics like rsquared and RMSE. 

**peranalysis**

* mulParPerAnalysis: major class for parallel performance analysis 
      You can setup many configure parameters for each network (a duty)
      and then run them to the effects in a parallel way. See this class 
      and its member functions' help for details.  

**data**

* data: function to access each of two datasets,  
         sim': simulated dataset in the format of Pandas's Data Frame,
         'pm2.5':string, the name for a real dataset of the 2015 PM2.5 
         and the relevant covariates for the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan
         area. It is sampled by the fraction of 0.8 from the
         the original dataset (stratified by the julian day).
         See this function's help for details.  
* simdata: function to simulate the test dataset,  
         The simulated dataset generated according to the formula:
         y=x1+x2*np.sqrt(x3)+x4+np.power((x5/500),0.3)-x6+
         np.sqrt(x7)+x8+noise
         See this function's help for details.

## Installation

You can directly install it using the following command for the latest version:
```
pip install resautonet -U
```
You can also clone the repository and then install:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lspatial/resautonet.git
cd package 
pip install ./setup.py install 
```

With the `setup.py` file included in this example, the `pip install` command will
invoke CMake and build the resautonet module as specified in `CMakeLists.txt`.


## Note for installation and use 

**Compiler requirements**

resautonet requires a C++11 compliant compiler to be available.

**Runtime requirements**

resautonet requires installation of Keras with support of Tensorflow or other 
backend system of deep learning (to support Keras). Also Pandas and Numpy should 
be installed.
